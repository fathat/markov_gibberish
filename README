This is some code I wrote for playing around with Markov chains to generate random poems and words.

It turns out most of these poems end up sounding really dark, and most of the words end up sounding inappropriate. Further proof that technology is witchcraft, I'd say. 

Here's an example output from make_poem.py: 

    jack sprat was wheeling,
    his wife could eat no lean
    and when they were down, they were down, they were down
    and when they were only halfway up
    they licked the hill
    and he had ten thousand men
    he marched them up nor down. 


(It almost makes sense!)

Sometimes it will actually say something rather profound:

    and when they were down, they were neither up nor down. 

You can seed it with anything, but it will almost always end up sounding really really creepy. Some might say that's it's charm.

Here's an example of words it might come up with:

    dingsbidentalun, ingvow, harpergrippers, exexpos, calctufacal, hornwormgapingly, added, ginyodelledyodeling, mosparamosver, iciambusbiesrara, rateexcrete, planu, loaninggleaner, liotscheviesex, idoimpark, sorsorsorsor, spondreverts, mascurassubraces, mucoscis, carryons, bryosalaninsrule, corumcimba, ing, ousstrat, un, piliformen, biesbachi, , helicpari, heartilyflash

I'll ingvow your harpergrippers!!! THAT'S CALCTUFACAL!
